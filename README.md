# API
The Weather App was created using a couple of different API calls from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)
## APIs Used:
- [Geocoding API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api) - This API was called to get latitude and longitude for the entered city.
- [Current weather data](https://openweathermap.org/current) - This API was called to get the current weather using the latitude and longitude for the entered city.
- [5 day weather forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) - This API was called to get the 5-Day Forecast Data for the entered city.
## Installation Steps
